*Responsibilities:*
  * Manage other components
  * look good

*TODO:*
  * incorporate styles in code completions

== TikzDisplay ==
*TODO*
  * pdflatex hangs sometimes (??how to reproduce??)
  * crisp toolbar bitmaps (no aliasing)

== Rasterizer ==
*TODO*

== TikzParser ==
*TODO*
  * Support \foreach (..at least ignor properly)
  * check math expresions in arc are handled correctly
  * arc followed by bezier handled correctly??
  * better error recovery: if error on \path is detected-> just drop this path instead of stopping parsing of whole file.
  * node names with empty space.. also in uniquefier

=== Tikz ParseTree ===
  * check again whether missing nodenames are treated right
  * Use Length property

== PdfOverlay ==
*TODO*
  * Automatically indent inserted Code properly
  * ellipse & rectangle -tool: supported rotated coordinate system
  * use polar not working for almost any tool  
  * stop sign when no WYSIWYG possible
  * tooltips for nodes after coordinates

=== Snippetmanager ===
*TODO*
  * Change snippet baseclass to list
  * use SnippetList class for Snippet List ?
  * delete snippet on DEL

=== TexCompiler ===
*TODO*
  * timeout vs package download....?

== Deployment ==
*TODO*
  * Check for PdfLatex in place
  * Check that necessary tex packages are there
  * Welcome screen as Tikzpicture on first load :-) ?
  * check texlive/miktex (because of pdflatex parameter)

== Usability ==
*TODO*
  * jump to source on dbl click
  * Texlive test+error
  * other errors
  * wrong scope box for dudplicate labels
  * tool:deduplicate labels
  * solution for different paths
  * solution for undefined commands
  * support \tikz{ }
  * improve workflow

=== Misc ===
*TODO*
  * change snippets and settings texteditors to texteditorex
  * scopes sometimes too big if name conflicts are present
  * 3d support? (=ignore it automatically)
  * Scrolling also if overlay is off (with Ctrl+wheel)
  * wysiwyg delete, wysiwyg enscope+copy
  * immediately type text after inserting or selecting nodes (or jump to position with double click)
  * reposition selected items with cursors
  * sometimes raster vanishes after parse error. Raster not redrawn after focus regained(ALT+TAB)
  * MRU list: somtimes files are not added
  * file for which parsing failed is not taken into mru list after save!
  * download of tikz manual-> display status bar+speed
  * edge node to itself -> loop
  * tooltips (esp. on snippets) open for longer time
  * Improve documentation
  * Ensure MRU stored in same folder as rest of config files...
  * outsorce code completions as separate lib
  * support multiple tikzpictures
  * allow for no pictures in snippets and add some commands. maybe allow to switch between picture and no picture view more easily
  * support tikzpictures anywhere on page (using http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10343/determining-the-position-of-a-box-e-g-on-a-page)
