#summary Describes the antlr generated parser and specifies the structure of the AST produced.

== The SimpletikzParser ==
The heart of the Parser is the Antlr generated class SimpleTikzparser, who parses an input document and returns an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) describing it.

The AST must have the following structure:
(Note: all node types have token names like `IM_SOMETHING`..)

The single root node is always `IM_DOCUMENT`

As children, the following nodes are allowed:
  * `IM_TIKZEDT_CMD`: It describes an internal command. (starting with "% !TIKZEDT")
  * `IM_TIKZSET`: It describes a \tikzset clause (i.e., options)
  * `IM_STYLE`: It descibes a \tikzstyle clause.
  * `IM_PICTURE`: This is the most important node, it describes the tikzpicture environment.

The structure (and children) of the above nodes is as follows:

== `IM_TIKZEDT_CMD` ==
== `IM_TIKZSET` ==
== `IM_STYLE` ==
== `IM_PICTURE` ==
