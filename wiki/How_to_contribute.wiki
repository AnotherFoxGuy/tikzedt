#What is still to be done.

= How to contribute =

The authors (Thomas and Julian) hope you enjoy TikzEdt.
In case you want to contribute to the further development, there are many ways:
  * Suggest new features.
  * Complain about bugs.
  * Share your experience as a user. Are you using TikzEdt for Tikz editing or have you switched to another editor? How could the workflow be improved?
  * If you are a programmer and know C#/WPF well, you could help in coding. Furthermore we would like to port TikzEdt to a less Windows dependent platform in the future, but currently don't have enough manpower.
